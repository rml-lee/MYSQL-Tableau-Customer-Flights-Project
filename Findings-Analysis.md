- Prior to 2015, the number of male and female enrollments was roughly equal, but over time, more females have tended to enroll compared to males. 

- Recommendation: Reassess the dynamics of the current marketing and advertising campaign to help tailor future promotions and strategies for attracting a more balanced enrollment base.

- The 2018 promotion campaign occurred from February to the end of April. Without the promotion program, we would normally receive around 200 enrollments. 

- The 2018 promotion campaign overall was a success, netting an additional 100 to 150 new customers per month while it was active.

- April was the strongest month during the promotion, which yielded a total of 346 new customers. 

- Recommendations: Continue to implement the promotion program annually and explore new creative ways to advertise and market it to attract new customers.

- The Churn Rate overall has been relatively low, hovering around 1% throughout the year of 2018. This indicates that thereâ€™s a high level of customer retention.
  
- The small decline in churn rate during the second quarter is likely due to the amount of new customers obtained during the 2018 promotion.
  
- Recommendations: Continue to understand the customer. Continuously gather and analyze customer feedback to understand their needs, preferences, and grievances. Use surveys, focus groups, and social media listening tools. This will help maintain and potentially improve churn rate.
